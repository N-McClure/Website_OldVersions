# Website_OldVersions
This repo will have all of my past versions of my portfolio / personal website.

Since my first week of Web Dev in sem 1 of year 1 of college I thought about and designed my site because I wanted a place to have my projects be able to live and run on.
With each different iteration, the site became better. Better design, Better coding arcitecture, Better all around.
